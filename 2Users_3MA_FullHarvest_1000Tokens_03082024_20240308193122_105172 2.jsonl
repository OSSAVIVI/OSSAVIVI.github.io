In the golden age of orthodontics, practitioners held a legalized monopoly and enjoyed the respect of many. This was a time when being an orthodontist was considered one of the top 10 earning and regarded vocations in numerous polls.\\n\\nThe profession was highly respected, with parents encouraging their children to become orthodontists. The key to achieving this esteemed position was a strong focus on sales and marketing.\\n\\nHowever, with the emergence of disruptors like Smile Direct Club, the landscape has changed. Orthodontists now face competition and must adapt to new challenges.\\n\\nIn order to maintain and strengthen our position in our communities, it's essential to uphold the principles of integrity, honesty, and strong moral principles. This includes treating transfer patients and offering second opinions with respect and fairness.\\n\\nBy doing so, we can continue to build trust and respect within our communities and in the eyes of our patients.\\n\\n[Tag: Embrace Progress: Treating Transfer Patients with Respect Earns Rewards]"}]}}
