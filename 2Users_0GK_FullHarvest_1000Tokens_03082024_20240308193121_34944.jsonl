Gum disease has been linked to various systemic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How is it treated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Treatment for gum disease can vary depending on the severity of the condition. For milder cases, a professional dental cleaning to remove plaque and tartar can be sufficient. More advanced cases may require non-surgical treatments, such as scaling and root planing, to remove plaque and tartar from below the gum line and promote gum reattachment. In severe cases, surgical procedures, like gum grafting or flap surgery, might be necessary.\\n\\nAdditionally, maintaining good oral hygiene at home, including brushing, flossing, and using an antimicrobial mouthwash, is crucial in managing gum disease. In some cases, lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking and improving your diet, can also help improve the condition. Regular dental check-ups and periodontal maintenance visits are essential for monitoring and managing gum disease.\\n\\n[Tag: Dental Facts]"}]}
