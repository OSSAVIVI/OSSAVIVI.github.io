Certain foods: Garlic, onions, and spicy foods can cause bad breath.\\n2. Poor dental hygiene: If you don't brush and floss regularly, food particles can remain in your mouth, promoting bacterial growth and causing bad breath.\\n3. Gum disease: Persistent bad breath can be a sign of gum disease, such as periodontitis or gingivitis.\\n4. Dry mouth: Saliva helps clean your mouth and wash away food particles. When your mouth is dry, these particles can linger and cause bad breath.\\n\\nTo maintain fresh breath, ensure you maintain good oral hygiene, stay hydrated, and avoid foods that cause bad breath.

Howard mentioned that dentists should be more like coaches in sports, being present and leading the team. What are your thoughts on this? [/INST]Hi Mikhail, I think it's a great point Howard made. Leadership in dentistry is essential for a successful practice. Here's how I see it:\\n\\n# Dentists as Coaches\\n\\nDentists should walk the floor, interact with their team, and be present in the practice. By doing so, they can lead their team more effectively and address issues proactively.\\n\\nWhen a dentist is done with a root canal, they should be more approachable and open to communication with their team. This allows for a more cohesive and efficient work environment.\\n\\nBeing present in the waiting room, hygiene rooms, and other areas of the practice helps to create a better patient experience. Addressing issues like running late, for example, shows that the dentist cares about their team and patients.\\n\\n# Trainable Leadership\\n\\nAbsolutely, leadership skills can be trained. Developing leadership skills in dentists can help improve their practice, team dynamics, and patient relationships.\\n\\nA few ways to train leadership skills include:\\n\\n- Mentorship and coaching programs\\n- Workshops and seminars\\n- Books and online resources\\n- Peer-to-peer learning and networking\\n\\nRemember, the best leaders are those who are always learning and open to new ideas.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on this, Mikhail?

Is there any difference between upper and lower six-year molars for entry-level implant cases? [/INST]Hey Mikhail, I'm glad you asked.\\n\\n# Slam Dunk Cases for Implantology\\n\\nAs a beginner, you should look for single canal endo implant cases. These are cases that are not in the esthetic zone, especially for high needs women. An easy case might be an upper bicuspid with lots of bone (at least 10mm of height and width) that is not in the esthetic zone.\\n\\n# Low Hanging Fruit in Missing Teeth\\n\\nWhen it comes to missing teeth, the six-year molars are the most likely to be missing in American data. These cases are relatively straightforward for most people. However, the bone can be a bit dodgy on the lower, lingual side. If you can stick your finger in and feel if the bone goes down beside the lingual or it takes off inside, you can tell if it's a challenging case.\\n\\n# Upper vs. Lower Six-Year Molars\\n\\nThere is not a big difference for beginners between upper and lower six-year molars for entry-level implant cases.\\n\\n# Surgical Guides\\n\\nAs for using a surgical guide for the first six-year molar replacement, it is a matter of personal preference. However, it can be helpful for beginners to ensure accuracy and precision in their implant placement.\\n\\n[Tag: Implantology]</s>"}

Nevins suggests that the easiest sites to start with for placing dental implants are a lower first molar site or a maxillary second bicuspid. The maxillary second bicuspid is considered the least stressful, especially if the patient has a relatively healthy dentition and no issues with the inferior alveolar nerve anatomy. This is because the maxillary second bicuspid site does not have the same complications as a lower molar site. The ease of the procedure depends on the size of the ridge and the availability of tomography for measurements.\\n\\nDr. Nevins also recommends using 3D tomography for treatment planning, which he has been using since dental school. He emphasizes the importance of simulating surgery for implants and using surgical guides generated from scans.

[/INST]Dr. Nevins believes that a CBCT is less likely to be required for a maxillary second bicuspid site compared to other areas in the dentition. However, he suggests using a comb beam CT for precise measurements and planning. Dr. Nevins has been using 3D tomography since dental school and has found it valuable for implant dentistry, as it allows for simulation of surgery and the use of surgical guides for accurate implant placement.\\n\\n[Tag: Dr. Marc L.

Without crazy insane growth with an influx of a million new patients for him to see, he will feed off your current patients and a few new patients here and there. In other words, he will not likely contribute much to the overall gross number.\\n\\nThe best way to bring in a partner is to start him as an associate for 2-3 years with a goal of growing your practice and hopefully doubling your gross production. That takes a ton of work. Many can't do it in 2-3 years.\\n\\nIf your practice is already producing crazy numbers like $2-2.5 million, then a cut in pay won't be as substantial.\\n\\nIn your case, you're currently at an office FT with zero advertising, taking a majority of insurance plans, and in an affluent area. The area is relatively competitive and averaging between 30-100 NP a month, typically around 50. Obviously, you need more NP, as the current operative/hygiene schedule is extremely sparse.\\n\\nTo answer your question, it's a dream office, the owner is fantastic and she'd be an awesome partner. Staff is amazing too, but how much time does one put into a gig? Not a fan of riding a gravy train.\\n\\nIf you want to discuss this further or have any other questions, I\u2019m always here to help.\\n\\n[Tag: Pediatric Dentistry]</s> [INST] What is the best product for demineralization/high caries, MI Paste or Soothe Rx?

[/INST]Hi Mikhail, it's great to hear that you're considering starting your own practice and have a solid plan.\\n\\n# Hiring a Hygienist vs. Assistant\\n\\nHiring a hygienist one day a week at $25 an hour is average around your area.

Some dentists argue that DSOs are a threat to the traditional dental practice model, while others defend their existence.\\n\\nDSOs are often criticized for their lower fees, which some believe compromise the quality of care. Critics argue that DSOs should pass the savings on to patients instead of keeping them as profits.\\n\\nOn the other hand, DSOs highlight their benefits, such as offering affordable dental care, having a national presence, and providing a better work-life balance for dentists. They also argue that they can help dentists by providing resources and support that may not be available in smaller, private practices.\\n\\nIn this discussion, a DSO representative states that they are fine and that the blame game is not helpful. They also mention that many solo practitioners struggle with internal issues, such as fighting and slitting each other's throats, while DSOs continue to expand and attract disillusioned patients and staff.\\n\\nIn the end, the debate comes down to the differences between DSOs and solo practices, and what each offers to patients and dentists.

DDS GP is available for a low, one-time price, with no subscription or annual fee.\\n\\n# Dentrix iPad Support\\n\\nDentrix has announced that they will be releasing iPad support mainly for the purpose of being a kiosk. This will allow patients to fill out forms, sign documents, and use it as a signature pad.\\n\\n# Future of Tablets in Dentistry\\n\\nTablets like the iPad and Android devices are becoming increasingly popular in medicine and dentistry.

[/INST]Hi Mikhail, it's important to follow up with your patients, but sometimes things are out of our control.\\n\\n# Patient Swelling\\n\\nThe patient probably would have swelled whether you took the tooth out or not. It's essential to educate patients about the risks and what they can do to help minimize the chance of complications.\\n\\n# Communication and Smoking\\n\\nYou did a good job by asking if she smoked after the extraction. It's important to communicate the risks of smoking, especially after a dental procedure.\\n\\n# Rinsing with Salt-H2O\\n\\nRinsing with salt-h2o can help reduce the risk of infection. It would have been good to remind her to rinse with salt-h2o, but it's not a guarantee that she would have followed your advice.\\n\\n# Lessons Learned\\n\\nIn the future, consider setting up a follow-up appointment or phone call to ensure the patient is recovering well.

We use one back-office assistant and offset their lunch. The procedure usually takes 15-20 minutes of doctor time.\\n\\nWhen the patient arrives, new photographs are taken to prepare for the appointment and then loaded and displayed at the clinical chair.\\n\\nWe use a compound topical anesthetic. Application involves placing the patient in cheek retractors with slow suction to prevent swallowing of the topical. The numbing gel is administered using a small syringe along the gingival margin, left on for 5 minutes, then suctioned off.\\n\\nThe patient then sits for 5 more minutes. We prepare the laser, and use the Spectralase 980, an ultrapulse diode laser, which requires the patient, assistants, and doctor to all wear protective eyewear.\\n\\nWe then begin the procedure, typically performing the contour from second bicuspid to second bicuspid on the upper arch, starting with a test spot in the posterior, then scalloping the gingival margins.\\n\\nContact with the tissue is not necessary; the longer the laser is held active in a location, the more tissue that will be removed. Slow passes accomplish the most. In many cases, it is helpful to debulk the tissue to aid in proper margin creation.\\n\\nThis is done simply by thinning the tissues and papilla. Normally, this procedure is done at the 12 o\u2019clock position.

[/INST]Hi Mikhail, I've summarized the discussion for you.\\n\\n# Dental Implant Quality: A Discussion\\n\\nDuring a discussion on Dentistry Uncensored, Dirk U. Duddeck, DDS at MegaGen, shared his insights on dental implant quality. According to Duddeck, they found impurities in up to 25% to 30% of implants, with some minor and some major particles. These particles were detected using a scanner electron microscope with a special technique that examines backscattered electrons to provide information about the topography and elements of the sample.\\n\\nDifferent particles, such as tungsten, chromium, nickel, stainless steel, organic contamination, and remnants of PTFE (Teflon), were found. Duddeck pointed out that implant manufacturers should be transparent about these issues and warn patients and doctors, similar to food packaging that lists potential allergens.\\n\\nDuring the discussion, Duddeck mentioned that MegaGen is one of the finest implant manufacturers he has seen, and larger companies usually have better quality management, as they control the production process more closely than midsize companies. There are around 1,000 implant manufacturers worldwide, and Duddeck estimates that only 400 of them meet a certain quality standard.\\n\\n[Tag: Implant Quality and more]</s> [INST] Can you discuss the importance of implant quality and its impact on dental health?

Duddeck, DDS, pointed out that if the implant quality is not up to the mark, it can lead to issues like peri-implantitis, infection, and bone loss.\\n\\nWhen the implant has a rough surface, it can collect bacteria, leading to infection. Infection, in turn, can cause parent and leukocyte, which may eventually result in peri-implantitis and further bone loss. This can cause a series of problems like the loss of an implant and unhappy, complaining patients.\\n\\nIt's essential to be aware of these risks and choose high-quality implants to ensure the best possible outcomes for your patients.

In the U.S., 70% of the population takes one prescription medication per day, and 50% take two or more. This can lead to dry mouth, making it difficult to achieve isolation in the mouth for dental procedures.\\n\\n2. **Diet**: The American diet consists of 23 teaspoons of sugar per day, while the World Health Organization recommends only two-thirds of one teaspoon per day. Additionally, the U.S. consumes the most high fructose corn syrup of any country at 51 pounds per person per year. This excessive sugar intake and high-frequency eating habits contribute to dental caries.\\n\\nWhen assessing patients, consider asking about dry mouth and their dietary habits.

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] What are the challenges faced by family dentistry, both present and future? [/INST]Hi Mikhail, here's a breakdown of the challenges faced by family dentistry:\\n\\n## Converting new patients into limiteds is the future\\n\\nConverting new patients into limiteds can be a good strategy for the future. It's essential to focus on providing a comprehensive solution to the patients' dental needs, including both basic and advanced treatments.\\n\\n## Hygiene as a Profit Center\\n\\nHygiene can be a profitable aspect of a dental practice. However, using it as a loss leader is not recommended. It's like offering free haircuts to attract more customers to a pizza shop, which is not an effective strategy. Instead, focus on marketing to people who are genuinely interested in dental care.\\n\\n## Hygiene Shortage\\n\\nAs the hygiene shortage continues, it becomes more challenging to maintain a hygiene-focused practice. The current shortage of qualified hygienists can make it difficult to grow and sustain the business.\\n\\n## Limited Skills and CE\\n\\nSome dentists may face limitations in their skills, especially when it comes to more complex procedures like major rehabs. To overcome this challenge, it's necessary to invest in continuous education and training to expand your skillset.\\n\\n## Unreliable Patients\\n\\nPatients who have neglected their dental health for years can be challenging to manage. Once you fix their primary concern, there is a higher failure rate and a risk of last-minute cancellations. Implementing larger deposits or improving scripting can help address this issue.\\n\\n## Balancing Hygiene and Large Cases\\n\\nThe vision for a successful practice is to have a good balance between hygiene patients and larger cases. However, it's not as easy as just deciding to treat neglected mouths. It requires a well-thought-out strategy and careful execution.\\n\\n## Marketing and Projecting the Right Image\\n\\nMarketing the practice as a place for those with good teeth and avoiding the image of a family dentist can help attract the desired clientele.\\n\\nIn summary, family dentistry faces various challenges, including hygiene shortages, limited skills, unreliable patients, and marketing. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of continuous education, improved marketing strategies, and careful patient management.\\n\\n[Tag: Future Planning General Discussions]</s>"}

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] I'm a new grad with student loans and considering refinancing. Can you help me with some advice? [/INST]Hi Mikhail, I'd be happy to help you with your student loans. Here's my advice:\\n\\n1. Pay off the UNSUBSIDIZED loans with your savings as much as you can.\\n2. Consider enrolling in community college gym classes for 6 credits. It's an affordable way to get a gym membership and continue your education.\\n3. It's not necessary to declare a physical fitness major, but you can take classes that interest you and help you maintain a healthy lifestyle.\\n4. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to save more, you can consider taking fewer classes per semester or year.\\n\\nBy staying enrolled in college, you can keep your subsidized loans at the same amount. This strategy can help you save more money and pay off your student loans more efficiently.\\n\\nKeep in mind that this advice is based on a specific situation and might not be suitable for everyone. Always consult with a financial advisor to ensure you make the best decision for your personal situation.\\n\\n[Tag: Personal Finance]</s>"}

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] Recommend a hands-on laser course for learning how to use it for frenectomies? [/INST]Hey, Mikhail! I'm glad to help you with your question.\\n\\n# Laser Course Recommendations\\n\\nWPS456 suggests checking out Lightscapel's website, which offers good videos and a list of courses. They also offer discounts on lasers if you attend their courses.\\n\\nDr. Baxter has been generous with his time and knowledge, and you can try out his laser if you visit him. Alternatively, you can try WPS456's laser if you head his way this winter.\\n\\nCallahancs mentions the Beamer, which is endorsed by Dr. David Winn. The Beamer may be faster and better than the Picasso Lite, which Callahancs found slow and frustrating.\\n\\nWhen it comes to frenectomies, the cutting is not the only challenge. You need to know when to stop cutting. Courses can emphasize not going far enough, so you can try to err on the side of aggressive cutting. However, it's essential to avoid reattachment.\\n\\nThere are pediatric dentists in your area who advertise and offer treatment for tongue- and lip-ties. It's worth considering sending infant frenectomies to them for comprehensive care.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any other questions or need more information on this topic!\\n\\n[Tag: Pediatric Dentistry]</s>"}

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] Can anyone provide some advice on creating an esthetic 7/8 crown for a maxillary first molar? [/INST]Hi Mikhail, I'd be happy to help you with that.\\n\\nTo avoid some metal showing, you can consider using a porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) crown or an all-ceramic crown. These options can provide better aesthetics compared to a traditional gold crown.\\n\\nRegarding the 7/8 crown, I've seen preps where the distobuccal (DB) and lingual cusps are prepped, axially prepped, and the mesiobuccal (MB) cusp is left intact, merely showing.\\n\\nIf you want to discuss luting agents and their impact on success rates with gold inlays and onlays, I'd be happy to help.

[/INST]Hi Mikhail, I couldn't find a specific reference (#11) in our previous conversation. However, I can provide you with some general insights.\\n\\nLuting agents can play a role in the success of gold inlays and onlays. The choice of luting agent can influence the bond strength, microleakage, and long-term stability of the restoration. Some luting agents can also improve the aesthetics of gold inlays and onlays.\\n\\nThat being said, the choice of luting agent should be based on the specific clinical situation, the patient's needs, and the desired outcome. I would recommend discussing the options with your colleagues and considering the latest research and recommendations from dental organizations.\\n\\n[Tag: Restorative Dentistry]</s> [INST] Can you share your experience with the Glidewell mini implant system?

Let's discuss some of the key points.\\n\\n## Market Forces and Quality\\n\\nSome dentists have high fees and fancy offices, while others with low fees do amazing work. It's important to focus on the quality of care and not just the fees.\\n\\n## Patient Choices and Value\\n\\nPatients might choose your office because you refer to PPO specialists. However, if this is your main value, it might be worth reconsidering. Consider offering more value to your patients, such as high-quality care and personalized attention.\\n\\n## PPO Plans and Write-offs\\n\\nRemember, you can't spend production, only collections. It's essential to focus on collecting what you can, rather than dwelling on what you could have charged.\\n\\n## Specialist Perspective\\n\\nAs a specialist, you might consider signing up for PPO plans that cover various procedures, such as extractions, sedation, grafts, and implants. This way, you can present the case as a total-fee, making it easier to manage write-offs.\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nUltimately, the decision to participate in PPOs depends on your practice's goals and values.

Here's some advice from other individuals who have undergone similar surgeries.\\n\\n# Recovery and Experience\\n\\nJoseph, a dentist, had a mitral valve repair in 2012 and was out of work for about 5 weeks. He mentioned that the first two days after surgery were rough, but he started feeling better by day 3. He returned to the office for paperwork during week 4 and started working with lighter schedules in week 5.

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] I have a question about the need for small access in endodontics. Can you share your insights on this? [/INST]Hey, Mikhail. I'd be happy to discuss the need for small access in endodontics.\\n\\n# Small Access in Endodontics\\n\\nSome dentists prefer a conservative approach, aiming for a small access that preserves tooth structure. This approach can be superb, as it minimizes the risk of iatrogenic damage.\\n\\n# Case Presentation\\n\\nIn the case you mentioned, the screw access was in the center of the crown, which made it easier to perform a small access. However, if the screw access is angled, it might be more challenging.\\n\\n# Tips for Small Access\\n\\n1. Inspect the screw: If the screw looks worn, consider carefully threading in a new screw.\\n2. Torque the screw: When you ask about screw loosening cases, you often get the answer that no torque wrench was used.\\n3. Check the crown stability: Torque the screw, cotton, GP, and Fermit-N to ensure the crown remains stable.\\n4. Crown repair: Crown repair boils down to a simple question. If there is porcelain, you can make it disappear. If the metal is exposed, it will never look good.\\n\\n# Materials for Small Access\\n\\nFor small access, you can use Kerr color white opaque, Cosmedent Pink Opaque, or Gradia AO3. These materials can help you achieve a successful and conservative outcome.\\n\\nHope this helps, Mikhail. If you have any other questions, I'm here to help.\\n\\n[Tag: Endodontics]</s> [INST] What are the concerns regarding allografts in dental practices? [/INST]Hey, Mikhail.

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] I have a patient who has had Invisalign for a few years, and her posterior teeth are not yet contacting. Maximum intercuspation means biting on her anterior teeth. She is considering regular braces. What are the chances conventional braces will close her bite? Here are some original pics of her bite in 2015 when she began clear braces. [/INST]Hi Mikhail, I appreciate the photos. Based on the information provided, I would need to consider the following:\\n\\n1. Original diagnosis and treatment plan\\n2. Patient's age and growth\\n3. Posterior open bite before Invisalign or just after treatment\\n\\nThe patient's photos from 2015 show an anterior edge-to-edge bite, and her teeth were chipping. It seems she has a significant class 3 canine on both sides, and her orthodontist might have run out of overjet.\\n\\nPossible solutions could be:\\n- Super heavy elastics\\n- More IPR on the lower\\n- Distalization of the lower arch\\n- Extraction of 4 bicuspids with minimal/maximum anchorage\\n- Orthognathic surgery\\n\\nKeep in mind that the patient's concerns are valid, and she might be hesitant to wear conventional braces with no improvement.

[/INST]Hi Mikhail, I understand your question and I'd be happy to discuss this further.\\n\\n# Cementing Crowns and Eliminating Cement Voids\\n\\nIt's not about the crown flexing, but rather the pressure difference between the crown and the environment. The idea is that a crown with an air space can create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the crown. This pressure difference could potentially lead to discomfort or pain for the patient.\\n\\nImagine you're at the bottom of a 200-feet deep dive, which is about 7 atmospheres or 100 psi. The crown in the mouth is exposed to this pressure. If the crown has an air space, the pressure inside the crown would be significantly lower than the surrounding water pressure.\\n\\nWhen the patient comes up to the surface, the pressure difference decreases, and the air space inside the crown expands, potentially causing discomfort or pain.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that there is no conclusive evidence to support this theory. The idea is still a topic of debate in the dental community.\\n\\nIf you have any other questions or if there's anything you want to discuss further, feel free to ask.\\n\\n[Tag: Fixed Prosthodontics]</s>"}

Today, we have access to various learning platforms such as webinars, podcasts, online/on-demand, and more.\\n\\n# The Impact on Quality\\n\\nSome people think that the quality of information might decrease with the involvement of private equity. The experience may also change, and it's hard to predict if it will be good or bad.
