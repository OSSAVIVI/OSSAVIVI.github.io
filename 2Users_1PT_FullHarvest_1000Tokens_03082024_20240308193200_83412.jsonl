Some reasons for this turnover include:\\n\\n1. **Lack of job satisfaction**: Associates may not feel fulfilled or satisfied in their roles, leading to them seeking opportunities elsewhere.\\n2. **Limited career growth**: Associates may not see a clear path for advancement or growth within the practice, prompting them to look for other positions.\\n3. **Work-life balance**: Associates may struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance, causing burnout and contributing to turnover.\\n\\nThe high turnover of associates can have a substantial impact on the industry. It can lead to decreased productivity, increased costs for recruitment and training, and a potential loss of institutional knowledge.\\n\\nIn some cases, corporate dental practices may not prioritize dentistry as a profit-making endeavor, but rather as a means to attract patients to their health insurance companies. This can create a challenging environment for associates, who may not feel aligned with the corporate goals.\\n\\nTo address this issue, dental practices can focus on improving job satisfaction, offering opportunities for career growth, and promoting a better work-life balance. By addressing these factors, practices can potentially reduce turnover and create a more stable and productive workforce.\\n\\n[Tag: Momentum Management]"}]}

For example, if you're looking at a CEREC demo, check the margins. If the margins are wide open, the vendor may not be able to sell you the system.\\n\\n2. **Communication**: Ensure that the vendor is open to answering your questions and providing information about their services.\\n\\n## Website Development and Hosting Costs\\n\\nA typical website development cost is around $4400, with a 10% Dentaltown discount available.

Two days later, I get a call from Dr. John. Dr. John says, \"Fred, I just met you two days ago, but I have a patient, an eight year old in my chair, that needs a root canal on tooth number three.\" That's the upper right, first permanent molar. He said, \"Her knees are shaking and I really don't want her to be in any pain. I heard the lecture about the laser. I was wondering if you could see the patient.\" I said, \"Send her on over and I don't molar root canals, but we can get her out of pain, do a pulpectomy and refer to the endodontist.\"  She came in with her father who brought the x-ray. I explained that to his daughter and to the father, that we were going to use a laser which will allow me to go ahead and repair the tooth, remove the decay, and get her comfortable. Jenny, if you have any problems, any discomfort I want you to raise your left hand. I said, \"Dad, I don't have enough laser glasses for everyone. You'll have to wait out in the reception room.\" You like that one, Howard? Yeah, that works.  In any case, when mom brought the rest of the x-rays and mom and dad came in to the operatory, I had gone ahead with the Erbium laser, prepared the tooth, gone into the pulp, did my pulpotomy, she never raised her hand once. Mom and dad, and this was a hot tooth, mom and dad came into the room and said, \"Jenny, how was it?\" She said, \"It was fun.\" Now, I don't know how many of your patients, but most of us, we have patients that have hot teeth either primary or permanent and it's not so much fun. In any case, that's a good case and point.\u00a0  I like it for my autistic patients as I mentioned, because the tooth is numb, but they don't have that numb feeling. I use it on my wife.

And it's stronger in dentistry or agriculture. It's stronger in the industries where the family owns the business and that's been handed down and it could be like Woolworths. I think I watched a show about Woolworths, about the third son. You know, \"I don't want to do a five-and-dime store.\" So that's one thing. I've seen and definitely talked and counseled some dentists who wanted to be a surgeon or wanted to be something else and it wasn't going to happen, and for whatever reason the family sees the surgeon in the family as better than the dentist in the family, which is a perception that's not accurate. But if that's the family you're in, if someone sees the surgeon as better than the dentist or better than the CPA or better than the great guy who stays home and raises his kids while whatever your other choices. So I've had some dentists whose families don't respect what he's doing as much as a sibling. And then I have a lot of dentists who are just unhappy because it isn't what they thought. They don't want to run a business and all of the staff and they just hate it. They thought they'd be in business for themselves. That's what some of them thought. They thought, \"I don't have to go to work. I don't have to report to anybody. I don't have to have a boss. I'm going to run my own company,\" which is kind of the American dream. Not with the millennials; they know that's not true because they watched their parents screw that up. But back in that age, they thought that if they own their own business- And then they get to it and they're not free at all, they have compliance issues and regulations and all sorts of insurance and there's so much more to it. And they would just \u2014 I use the term dental \u2014 like to go \"dental-ing\" around. They would just like to go in their room and dental all day. They just want to dental, right? Do their dental-ing stuff. And they can't be that isolated; there's so much more to it. So I'm just giving you a few reasons why some dentists- But I have to tell you, in this last few years, I'm not seeing it like I did ten or fifteen years ago. I think today if a young man doesn't want to be a dentist, he'll tell his dad, \"Dad, too bad\" or a young woman, \"Too bad, I don't want to do this. So you'll have to sell the business.\" I think more of them are understanding it's a business because they get it, especially if they grew up in their mom or dad's business.

They might think that owning their own business means they won't have to report to anyone or deal with regulations, compliance issues, and insurance. However, the reality is that owning a business involves a lot more than just practicing dentistry.\\n\\n3. **Lack of creativity and fun**: Some dentists may not find their work fulfilling or enjoyable.

Now, a lot of this stuff I've got from Maui Bob on the Dentaltown forums, that's going to greatly increase the chances of getting that review, when the front desk does something about it and then your practice management software sends out that request for the review, whether it's a text message or an email, and then maybe you send out a postcard a few days later too.

Ask for a favor: At the end of the appointment, ask the patient if they would mind leaving a review for your practice.\\n2. Provide instructions: Let them know that they can leave a review on Google and that Angie at the front desk will provide more information.\\n3. Follow-up with your practice management software: Send out a request for a review via text message, email, or even a postcard a few days later.\\n\\nThis strategy is based on advice from Maui Bob on the Dentaltown forums. While it might feel uncomfortable at first, keep in mind that it's essential to ask for reviews to build your online presence and attract new patients.\\n\\nTo differentiate your practice, consider focusing on specific services or treatments that set you apart from competitors. Highlight these unique aspects in your marketing materials and during patient consultations to help your practice stand out.\\n\\n[Tag: Differentiate Your Practice]"}]}

And here's the rub, every one of us statistically will be misdiagnosed at least once in our life and if you're a complicated medical patient, a lot more than once. And where are we talking to each other? It's funny, I was speaking to a group of osteopaths, a large group of us who passed last summer, and I was giving them hell about proton pump inhibitors, I go, \"You guys know that these PPIs have a broad-based warning not for more than two weeks, okay? 60% of the America has reflux, let's talk about the root cause of this instead of just getting them on the pill and then they can just put them in a passive position then go eat whatever they want.\" So I said, \u2018Did you know it blocks dietary absorption of calcium, magnesium, iron, and B12.\" So you got osteoporosis because you're taking calcium from your bones, you pee it out through your kidneys, you got kidney stones. I go, \"Stop it.\" So afterwards one of the doc's came up to me and he said, \"I wish I'd heard you ten years ago.\" I said, \"Well, I wasn't even speaking ten years ago.\" And he said, \"I am a plastic surgeon for twenty years,\" he said \"My doctor had me on proton pump inhibitors for eight years. I trusted him. I'm not a GI doc. I don't know anything about reflux.\" He says, \"I'm on proton pump inhibitors and now I have pernicious anemia, I could spit.\" He said, \"He used to be a friend of mine, now I won't even talk to him.\" I said, \"Well, you know, he probably didn't know.\" He said, \"He knew, what am I gonna do, you have reflux. We have to worry about Barrett's Esophagus and esophageal cancer.\" And you talk about an awful combo with HPV increasing and acid up on the posterior pharynx, the combination of damaging cells and now the Pernicious HPV, twenty-five of these HPV viruses have caused cancer in the mouth, not just the one sixteen and eighteen we worry about. So we in an epidemic of oral and oropharyngeal cancer. And talk about pancreatic cancer, inflammation of the pancreas linked to cancer, where do you think the inflation is coming from?
