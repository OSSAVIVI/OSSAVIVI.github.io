This technology is particularly helpful during the diagnosis phase, revealing clear pathology that may not have been visible with traditional radiographs.\\n\\nIn one case, a patient presented with slight biting pain to tooth #14, which had previously received root-canal treatment. Clinical testing and conventional radiographs showed the tooth had a failing root canal with a chronic apical abscess. However, the CBCT showed an obvious fracture and significant bone loss that had been clinically undetectable. This discovery led to a change in the treatment plan from a re-treatment to an extraction with an implant.\\n\\nMost of their referrals come from general practitioners, but they also see a lot of returning patients who'd previously been treated by Dr. Inaba's grandfather or uncle.
