It is essential to market the practice to people who want the services offered and not give away free services to attract customers.\n\n3. **Hygiene shortage:** As the hygiene shortage continues, it is becoming more challenging to maintain a hygiene-focused practice. Losing a full-time hygienist can be detrimental to the practice.\n\n4. **Limited skills:** Focusing on larger \"needs\" based cases can be challenging if the dentist's skills are limited. It requires a significant amount of CE to get to the level of treating major rehabs.\n\n5. **Patient reliability:** Patients who have neglected their mouths for years are not reliable patients. Once you fix their chief concern, the fail rate on these patients is high, and it can be challenging to maintain momentum.\n\n6. **Projecting the right image:** It is essential to project the right image for the practice.
