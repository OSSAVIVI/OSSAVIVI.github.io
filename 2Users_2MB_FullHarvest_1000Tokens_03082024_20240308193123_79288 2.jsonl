I gave her a script for Clindamycin 300mg tid. She returned two days later, and we both felt the swelling had decreased slightly. I sent her to an oral surgeon for a second opinion. I called her at 5 pm, but she didn't answer. I'm worried because of her lack of response. She smokes 2.5 packs and admitted to smoking an hour after the extraction. She did not rinse with salt-h2o. Is there anything I could have done to handle the situation better?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The patient's smoking habits and lack of salt-h2o rinsing may have contributed to the swelling. It's important to stress the importance of post-extraction care to patients. However, the patient may have been prone to swelling regardless of the extraction.\\n\\nIn the future, consider providing detailed post-extraction care instructions and emphasize the importance of following them. You could also follow up with a text message or email if you cannot reach her by phone.\\n\\nHowever, in this case, it's essential to remain patient and understanding. Sometimes, complications arise, and it's crucial to maintain open communication with the patient to address any concerns.\\n\\n[Tag: Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery]"}]}}
