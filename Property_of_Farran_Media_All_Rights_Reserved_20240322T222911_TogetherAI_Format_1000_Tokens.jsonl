What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] What causes bad breath? [/INST]Bad breath, also known as halitosis, can be caused by various factors. Some common causes include:\\n\\n1. Certain foods: Garlic, onions, and spicy foods can cause temporary bad breath.\\n2. Poor dental hygiene: Not brushing and flossing regularly can lead to a buildup of bacteria, plaque, and food debris in the mouth, causing bad breath.\\n3. Gum disease: Chronic bad breath can be a sign of periodontal (gum) disease, which is caused by an infection in the gums.\\n4. Dry mouth: Saliva helps clean the mouth and wash away food particles. When the mouth is dry, there is less saliva to perform these functions, leading to bad breath.\\n\\nRegular oral care, such as brushing and flossing, and staying hydrated can help prevent bad breath. If you have persistent bad breath, it is essential to consult a dental professional for a proper evaluation and treatment.\\n\\n[Tag: Dental Facts]</s> [INST] What is a root canal procedure?

[/INST]## Math and Income Expectations\\n\\nWhen bringing in a partner to a pediatric dental practice, you should consider the financial impact. For example, if you're producing $1mill on your own with 55-60% overhead, you're clearing about $450k take-home. If a partner buys in at 50% and produces an additional $200k in the first year, the total office production would be $1.2mill. With 55-60% overhead, the net income would be $540k, which would need to be split in half with the new partner. This would leave you with a new income of $270k, effectively demoting your take-home.\\n\\nTo mitigate this, consider starting the partner as an associate for 2-3 years with a goal of growing the practice and doubling the gross production. This will require a lot of work, but it can help ensure that the new partner contributes significantly to the overall gross number.\\n\\n## Doctor Days and Associate Adjustment\\n\\nFor practices that do not take Medicaid, it can take 2-3 years to build the doctor days from adding an associate from PT to FT. This adjustment period depends on factors such as the practice's location, the number of new patients, and the level of advertising.\\n\\nIn the case of an office that is currently full-time with zero advertising, takes a majority of insurance plans, and is in an affluent area, adding an associate could help increase the number of new patients and improve the sparse operative/hygiene schedule. However, it is essential to weigh the time and effort required to grow the practice with the potential benefits of having a partner.\\n\\n[Tag: Pediatric Dentistry]</s>"}

[/INST]The DSO Blame Game refers to the ongoing debate between DSOs (Dental Service Organizations) and solo practitioners. Critics of DSOs argue that they are driving down the value of dental care by charging lower fees and relying on corporate resources to support their growth.\\n\\nDSOs, on the other hand, claim that they are simply providing a more efficient and accessible service for patients who may not be able to afford or do not see enough value in the higher prices charged by some solo practitioners.\\n\\nOne DSO representative highlights the need for solo practitioners to work together to compete with DSOs, instead of fighting among themselves. They also point out the importance of offering better services and pricing to attract patients, as the DSOs' marketing budgets and brand presence continue to grow.\\n\\nAnother DSO supporter emphasizes the importance of providing a consistent level of care, with full-time staff and a strong support system. They also highlight the benefits of DSOs for patients, including affordable pricing, money-back guarantees, and a national brand presence.\\n\\nIn summary, the DSO Blame Game is a complex issue with both advantages and disadvantages for patients and dental professionals.

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] Can you explain the 'breakaway' model in dentistry? How does it impact the efficiency and productivity of a dental practice? [/INST]The 'breakaway' model in dentistry, as explained by Scott, is a strategy that focuses on two key aspects: productivity per hour and overall sum.\\n\\n1. **Per hour dentist time worked**: This measures the efficiency and productivity of a dental practice based on the time invested by the dentist. For example, a practice that generates $1.2M in its first year, with an average of 4.4 days per week, or around $670 per hour, can be considered efficient. However, in a startup, it's essential to analyze the growth from the beginning. A practice with 11 dentist days per week, generating $786 per hour, is still growing and expanding its facilities and staff.\\n\\n2. **Overall sum**: This metric reflects the demand created in a specific area and indicates the potential of the practice. For example, a 2-year-old practice with $3.6M in production and 11 dentist days per week demonstrates explosive 'breakaway' growth.\\n\\nAn essential aspect of the 'breakaway' model is that a smaller practice with limited capacity can significantly increase its fees and profitability by capitalizing on high demand. For example, if a practice decides to operate with only one dentist, it can more than double its fees due to the excess demand, keeping the overall production numbers close to what they would be with multiple dentists.\\n\\n[Tag: Practice Management & Administrative Forum]</s>"}

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] I have a patient with Invisalign treatment for a few years, and her posterior teeth are not contacting. Maximum intercuspation means biting on her anterior teeth. The orthodontist suggested regular braces. What are the chances conventional braces will close her bite? Here are some original pics of her bite in 2015 when she began clear braces. [/INST]The patient's original bite in 2015 shows an anterior edge-to-edge bite, and her teeth were chipping. Based on the images, it appears she has a significant class 3 canine on both sides, and her orthodontist may have run out of overjet.\\n\\nTo address her concerns, it would be helpful to know the orthodontist's plan for her treatment. Some options might include:\\n\\n1. Super heavy elastics to help close the bite.\\n2. Palatal expansion to create more space.\\n3. IPR (Interproximal Reduction) to gain additional space for adjustments.\\n4. Distalization of the lower arch to help align the teeth.\\n5. Extraction of 4 bicuspids with minimal/maximal anchorage, which could lead to a Class I finish with proper overjet. However, this may negatively affect her profile and decrease the space for her tongue.\\n6. Orthognathic surgery, which is typically the last resort, but could be a solution if other methods are not effective.\\n\\nIt's important to consider the patient's concerns and fears when discussing these options. Make sure she understands the benefits and drawbacks of each approach so she can make an informed decision about her treatment.\\n\\n[Tag: Orthodontics]</s> [INST] Can an air space in a crown change pressure depending on atmospheric air? Is it possible for a crown to flex so that the air pocket in the crown changes pressure? [/INST]It is unlikely that an air space in a crown would change pressure depending on atmospheric air. The crown's rigidity and the seal's effectiveness play a role in preventing pressure changes.\\n\\nTo test this, you can try pressing hard on the crown with an amalgam plugger. In most cases, it would be difficult to get it to budge, and you would be exerting well over 100 psi. The pressure difference in the crown, even with a 5 psi change, would likely not be significant enough to cause any movement or pressure changes.\\n\\n[Tag: Fixed Prosthodontics]</s>"}

[/INST]When referring a patient to endo due to endo failure, it's essential to be transparent and empathetic. You might say:\\n\\n'I understand that you're experiencing some issues with your previous endodontic treatment. I believe that seeking a specialist's opinion will help us find the best solution for your situation. I will refer you to an endodontist who can evaluate your case and provide appropriate treatment.\\n\\nIt's important to wait for the specialist's assessment before making any decisions about refunds. If the endodontist determines that retreatment is necessary, I would be willing to work with you on a deal for a replacement. In today's PPO world, it's not feasible to raise fees to cover the cost of the replacement procedure.\\n\\nRemember, my primary goal is to ensure your oral health and satisfaction. I am committed to working with you to find the best solution for your situation.'\\n\\nBy being transparent and empathetic, you can maintain trust with your patient while ensuring they receive the best possible care.\\n\\n[Tag: Patient Communication / Education]</s>"}

[/INST]There is a debate in the dental community regarding the use of allografts and Bio-Oss in dental implants. Some claim that these materials are not osteoinductive and do not stimulate osteogenesis, and they also argue that we do not have a clear understanding of their success rates.\\n\\nCritics of allografts and Bio-Oss argue that these materials are never resorbed and never turn into normal bone. They claim that there is no scientific basis for placing implants in sockets grafted with these materials.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the use of allografts and Bio-Oss remains a topic of discussion and further research is needed to determine their effectiveness and safety in dental implants.\\n\\n[Tag: Implantology]</s>"}
