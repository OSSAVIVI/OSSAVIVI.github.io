Sinai Hospital NY. They were out of work for about 5 weeks, with the first two days post-op being the most difficult. By day 4, they were sent home, and their appetite slowly returned. Week 3 saw their energy returning, and week 4 they started going to the office for paperwork. Week 5, they returned to work with lightly scheduled days and no extractions for a few more weeks.\\n\\n## Preparation and Valve Type\\n\\nIn terms of preparation, the surgeon used a mitral valve repair in this case. It's essential to discuss the specifics of your surgery with your medical team, as they can provide tailored advice based on your situation.\\n\\n## Handling the Office\\n\\nDuring your recovery, consider delegating tasks to trusted colleagues or staff members.
