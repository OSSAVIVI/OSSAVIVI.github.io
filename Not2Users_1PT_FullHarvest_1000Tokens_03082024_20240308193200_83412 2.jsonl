Basically, they still make almost all the revenue from search and year, after year, after year, they'll lose a half billion dollars a year investing in all these other businesses and they never really seem to ever pan out. And then the next time, they report earnings again. It's still almost all their money is from search and so dentists are doing fillings, crowns and root canals and that's not working. So they think they're going to go into sleep apnea or Invisalign or some other you know, they're going to do it on TMJ. And as I was like, \"Dude, last year not even one percent of your revenue was TMJ and now you're on a six-week course.\"  And then I look at the .. Okay, last year, not even a half percent was from ortho and now you're going to some Invisalign course. Focus on search. You're a dentist, you have cleanings, you have a hygiene , you have fillings and crowns and stuff. If you can't crush it on your core competency like Google crushes on search, and I personally think Google throws away way too much money on all these superfluous ideas, which are really cool and sexy but at the end of the day, they cost half billion dollars, which all could have been profit given to their stockholders.\u00a0  So stick to your core business.

Can you really look at them and say, \"I can deliver you 10 more a month, 20 more a month?\" I mean so for people listening to you, if they went to your website right now, . \u00a0  Can they just call you up and say, \"Hey, dude.

What I do is not necessarily teaching sales, sales, sales. Instead teaching value, value, value. What is it that you want to do? What is the value of that? Do they understand the value of that? Do they know why it is worth it for a patient to do this? And then let's bring everyone along. Sometimes when I go in to work with dentists, they don't necessarily see the value of their dentistry. So that's one of the first thing I want to look at. I want to look at their treatment planning process even though I'm not a dentist. I want to see what is their thought process? Usually they just focus on one tooth or their staff member has already told them their insurance will pay for this and that's it. And so they focus on what kind of dentistry I can sell, if they even use that word, just within that insurance limitation. I rarely find a dentist who cannot communicate. If they can't communicate then I do want to hide them or not let them ruin it because sometimes they'll talk too soon. Talk too fast. Simple things like for example I time the consultation on doctors. How long does it take for a patient to accept treatment? How long? Is it five minutes, ten minutes? Is it 15 minutes or 45? I don't tell doctors talk five minutes and shut up. I just want to know when are you effective? When does a patient say yes in the conversation? When does the light bulb go on and they say oh I see this is what I want. When does that happen? Many times their staff members know and their staff members know when the doctor should shut up. Know what the doctor says that they shouldn't. I was in Nacogdoches, Texas, implant practice and the doctor wanted to do more implant dentistry. His staff told me, \"You know he'll talk and talk and talk to a patient going from treatment plan to treatment plan to treatment plan to treatment plan until they accept a swing lock partial. I'll never forget that visit. I didn't even know what a swing lock partial was. I said what do you mean? What's a swing lock partial? They showed me. Little posterior segments that clicked in, locked in. At any rate, I said what do you mean he talks and talks until they accept a swing lock partial? And they said, \"It's the last thing he's got to offer.\" He just presents this. If that doesn't hit he presents the next thing. If that doesn't hit he presents the next thing until the treatment value goes down and down and down and down and down until he has nothing of less value than the swing lock partial. I said so what should he do? They said, \"If he would just shut up patients would accept treatment.\" I said well how can we get him to shut up? One doctor I timed, if he talked more than 15 minutes we audited simply the function of time.

Mac OS free. Every update is free. They want you to be in the most current version. They want you to be the most secure because every fix, like for Meltdown and Spectre you know what I'm talking about in terms of the chips Meltdown and Spectre. They already had the fixes in from the end of last year. They just didn't publicize it because they didn't want to say to the hacker community, by the way, we know there's a problem, but we've got a fix for it in our operating system, they didn't want to publish it because they didn't want the hackers to take advantage of it. Those that didn't already know about it. They came up with, for the last three operating systems, they have updates that address Spectre and Meltdown and instead of, unlike in Windows where they had a fix, but then they said, \"don\u2019t install it\", because the first million people that installed it are now twenty to 30% slower and they're having to reboot their computer constantly. So, with Apple, that doesn't happen. So, they\u2019re much better and more current. IBM says that something like 80% of their Mac users are on the current operating system within thirty to sixty days. The Windows user tried to figure out some way to avoid updating to the most current version of Windows because the last time they did it, it messed him up for weeks before they got back to where they were again. So, they're trying to avoid it. So, it's a really big difference in terms of the security, but it's in the DNA of Apple that I gave you that story because I had that history with Apple. It's in their DNA to protect your privacy. So, everything that you read about the federal government can't crack an iPhone and Apple's not going to help them. Apple will help them with things, but not to crack an iPhone to get access to your data even though they'd like to help them to get access to just that other person's data, just the other hackers data or the other terrorists data. So that's in Apple's DNA. That's why Tim Cook stood up and said there's got to be regulation in social media. He said it because of the fact that.. he is a company that they have lived that way and they're protecting our data and the only way to avoid ransomware. So, if we talk about how does that apply to dentists, why is that important to dentists? So, it's important. Number one, because doctors, physicians, dentists, chiropractors, healthcare providers, hospitals, they're all subject to HIPAA fines and the fines are millions of dollars, but not just HIPAA fines.

Okay, so if you don't know you're getting an F or a D, what's the first rule a day a meeting? You have to admit you have a problem.

I would start measuring it first, then I realize, okay if half of our patients have bought a $30,000 new car, what's the difference? Well, you see the car it just says 30 grand. Then you sit there and you'll see if you can get approved. A lot of these people get approved before they go in there, but you know you're walking into the room and just saying, \"Hey, gosh. Congratulations, man\". We can do the whole thing, the whole $30,000 new car for just $450 a month for 60 months. Is that something you wanna do? 10% of the dentists can do that every single month.

Yes, I've seen some of the videos of some things you have done in training and teaching, treatment presentation and working with the apprehensive patient, but all of those things don't always cut it for the most extreme side. Anxiolysis, conscious sedation, deep sedation, a general anesthesia, if you can offer that service in these practices, to all of my colleagues in Southern California, and later nation-wide, it's a phone call away for the office to pick it up and say, \"Hey, guys, we need help with this patient. Can you come down?\" We come down, we put the patient at ease, they sleep and dream all of their anxieties away. We get to a quiet sense. I do a lot of full-mod rehabs, a lot of All-On-8's, All-On-4's, full-mod extractions, and it's really convenient when the patient is not gagging and is not regurgitating. You can do your work in a clean environment and knock it out in a speedy, and the patient is comfortable. They wake up, which is my biggest thing in dentistry, what I love is when they wake up with this newfound confidence. It's amazing. We thought that it would be a good idea to provide this service, like a double pack, to every practice in Southern California. When they call us, we bring our own carts, we go in, they have a room for us, we set up 15 minutes, we have already done all our homework on the patient's medical history and have given them all the instructions and the consents, and we get to work. The patients are happy and they spread the word, and it's a good situation. I think it's very important to offer this type of service to all patients. As you know, not everybody likes us.

You going to pick up twenty cats at the pound?\" \"No, I want homo sapiens.\" OK. Well then, take your website so you don't have 5% conversion. Let's get it to ten that land on your website, they call the office. When they call the office, we know right now everybody that measures this stuff say during working hours, eight to five, anywhere between 27% to 50% of the calls go to voicemail. Are you out of your mind? Any small business America would say, \"Oh, we need to hire another sales person.\" It reminds me of the autobiography of the founder of IBM, Thomas Watson, Jr., and he went to IBM and all he focused on, he says, \"I don't know computer stuff and I'm not going to get involved with that. I'm just going to focus on the sales.\" And he started a six-week training course where everybody got the three-piece suits. They went over every question they've ever been asked. The whole class studied for six weeks with a briefcase, a suit. These are all the questions. And all he did is worked on his sales and he said, \"If 70% of all the computer salesmen in the world worked for IBM, we'll have 70% of the market share.\" And these dentists can't tell you if yesterday, they had thirty incoming calls or sixty. They can't tell you where they came from. They can't tell you what percent went to voicemail. And then the hygienist -- on top of all that -- the hygienist and the assistant, instead of the hygienist scheduling a six-month recall or the assistant scheduling the next appointment, they just go out and throw the chart on the front and say, \"You do it,\" as if she's a clerk. Man, that lady is inbound sales. She's driving the whole show. You can go back through a hygienist and schedule your own damn appointment. Tell the assistant, \"You schedule the crown seat or the next one.\" Do it all in the back because the incoming calls are sacred, so that means 80% of dentists will never take her to a dental course, a dental convention, won't educate her, spend no time, no money. They just hire them off the street and put them in the most important job in the office. Then, they turn around and tell me they'd like to have twice as many patients.

If you look at the patient and just have a conversation with them in that chair we know the major risk factors are for dental caries. You know the number one is saliva. And for most patients now that's medication related. We've got 70% of our of our entire population in the U.S. take one prescription medication per day and that's across all age demographics. 50% take two or more and 20% five or more and you see these people every day in your dental practice and you sound [0.7] and they start talking in their mouth is dry. There was a study done in the JADA that was published a few years ago and it was a survey of patient self-reporting dry mouth and it was somewhere around 7%. We did the same study based on our caries risk assessment forms and they came in at 63% of my patients self-identified that they feel like they have a dry mouth at some time of the day or night. Some of this is related to other general systemic issues or auto immune stuff, but primarily it's medications. Howard, even our kids... We've got like seventeen million children in the United States taking anti... Psychiatric drugs, anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, ADHD drugs. That's the crazy part of this. We've got kids that are coming in with dry mouth when they sit down typically... You and I struggled with trying to get isolation in the mouth so you could do any dentistry, because there's so much saliva and now we've got kids that have dry mouth. So that's the number one risk factor for dental caries. So look at them and ask if they have a dry mouth. The second in our caries risk assessment for by survey, and this is now over thirteen thousand patients at six different dental practices, 55% of them self-identified that they have a dietary issue. They're either eating too much sugar or they're eating too frequently. They're snacking throughout the day and I think that's part of our lifestyle as well, but Howard, the American diet... We eat twenty three teaspoons of sugar a day. I'd recommend everybody listening to this podcast is go home tonight, pull out a Ziploc bag and put twenty three teaspoons of sugar in there and see what that looks like. World Health Organization recommends that we should be eating somewhere around two thirds of one teaspoon per day. And on top of that we consume the most high fructose corn syrup of any country on the planet at fifty one pounds per person per year.
