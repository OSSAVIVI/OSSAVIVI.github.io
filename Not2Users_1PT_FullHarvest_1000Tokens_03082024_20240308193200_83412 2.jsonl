And then the next time, they report earnings again. It's still almost all their money is from search and so dentists are doing fillings, crowns and root canals and that's not working. So they think they're going to go into sleep apnea or Invisalign or some other you know, they're going to do it on TMJ. And as I was like, \"Dude, last year not even one percent of your revenue was TMJ and now you're on a six-week course.\"  And then I look at the .. Okay, last year, not even a half percent was from ortho and now you're going to some Invisalign course. Focus on search. You're a dentist, you have cleanings, you have a hygiene , you have fillings and crowns and stuff. If you can't crush it on your core competency like Google crushes on search, and I personally think Google throws away way too much money on all these superfluous ideas, which are really cool and sexy but at the end of the day, they cost half billion dollars, which all could have been profit given to their stockholders.\u00a0  So stick to your core business.

What I do is not necessarily teaching sales, sales, sales. Instead teaching value, value, value. What is it that you want to do? What is the value of that? Do they understand the value of that? Do they know why it is worth it for a patient to do this? And then let's bring everyone along. Sometimes when I go in to work with dentists, they don't necessarily see the value of their dentistry. So that's one of the first thing I want to look at. I want to look at their treatment planning process even though I'm not a dentist. I want to see what is their thought process? Usually they just focus on one tooth or their staff member has already told them their insurance will pay for this and that's it. And so they focus on what kind of dentistry I can sell, if they even use that word, just within that insurance limitation. I rarely find a dentist who cannot communicate. If they can't communicate then I do want to hide them or not let them ruin it because sometimes they'll talk too soon. Talk too fast. Simple things like for example I time the consultation on doctors. How long does it take for a patient to accept treatment? How long? Is it five minutes, ten minutes? Is it 15 minutes or 45? I don't tell doctors talk five minutes and shut up. I just want to know when are you effective? When does a patient say yes in the conversation? When does the light bulb go on and they say oh I see this is what I want. When does that happen? Many times their staff members know and their staff members know when the doctor should shut up. Know what the doctor says that they shouldn't. I was in Nacogdoches, Texas, implant practice and the doctor wanted to do more implant dentistry. His staff told me, \"You know he'll talk and talk and talk to a patient going from treatment plan to treatment plan to treatment plan to treatment plan until they accept a swing lock partial. I'll never forget that visit. I didn't even know what a swing lock partial was. I said what do you mean? What's a swing lock partial? They showed me. Little posterior segments that clicked in, locked in. At any rate, I said what do you mean he talks and talks until they accept a swing lock partial? And they said, \"It's the last thing he's got to offer.\" He just presents this. If that doesn't hit he presents the next thing. If that doesn't hit he presents the next thing until the treatment value goes down and down and down and down and down until he has nothing of less value than the swing lock partial. I said so what should he do? They said, \"If he would just shut up patients would accept treatment.\" I said well how can we get him to shut up? One doctor I timed, if he talked more than 15 minutes we audited simply the function of time.

Dr. Leon: Well you know I have to say that orthodontists are stepping up and sites are getting better. But so you know, A B C I don\u2019t know, they are getting better but what\u2019s missing from the website is the relationship of the website to their message. What\u2019s their distinctive message? What\u2019s their differentiator? What are they really good at? What do they represent? And you know, and their website should be a visual representation of that not pretty colors. You know, pretty colors are better than what it used to be which were ugly colors but it\u2019s still not where it should be.

They came up with, for the last three operating systems, they have updates that address Spectre and Meltdown and instead of, unlike in Windows where they had a fix, but then they said, \"don\u2019t install it\", because the first million people that installed it are now twenty to 30% slower and they're having to reboot their computer constantly. So, with Apple, that doesn't happen. So, they\u2019re much better and more current. IBM says that something like 80% of their Mac users are on the current operating system within thirty to sixty days. The Windows user tried to figure out some way to avoid updating to the most current version of Windows because the last time they did it, it messed him up for weeks before they got back to where they were again. So, they're trying to avoid it. So, it's a really big difference in terms of the security, but it's in the DNA of Apple that I gave you that story because I had that history with Apple. It's in their DNA to protect your privacy. So, everything that you read about the federal government can't crack an iPhone and Apple's not going to help them. Apple will help them with things, but not to crack an iPhone to get access to your data even though they'd like to help them to get access to just that other person's data, just the other hackers data or the other terrorists data. So that's in Apple's DNA. That's why Tim Cook stood up and said there's got to be regulation in social media. He said it because of the fact that.. he is a company that they have lived that way and they're protecting our data and the only way to avoid ransomware. So, if we talk about how does that apply to dentists, why is that important to dentists? So, it's important. Number one, because doctors, physicians, dentists, chiropractors, healthcare providers, hospitals, they're all subject to HIPAA fines and the fines are millions of dollars, but not just HIPAA fines. But also, state fines, every state except one or two in the United States has it's own privacy laws over and above HIPAA, which is the federal government's regulations.

I would start measuring it first, then I realize, okay if half of our patients have bought a $30,000 new car, what's the difference? Well, you see the car it just says 30 grand. Then you sit there and you'll see if you can get approved. A lot of these people get approved before they go in there, but you know you're walking into the room and just saying, \"Hey, gosh. Congratulations, man\". We can do the whole thing, the whole $30,000 new car for just $450 a month for 60 months. Is that something you wanna do? 10% of the dentists can do that every single month.

Can you come down?\" We come down, we put the patient at ease, they sleep and dream all of their anxieties away. We get to a quiet sense. I do a lot of full-mod rehabs, a lot of All-On-8's, All-On-4's, full-mod extractions, and it's really convenient when the patient is not gagging and is not regurgitating.

I'm just going to focus on the sales.\" And he started a six-week training course where everybody got the three-piece suits. They went over every question they've ever been asked.

And all he did is worked on his sales and he said, \"If 70% of all the computer salesmen in the world worked for IBM, we'll have 70% of the market share.\" And these dentists can't tell you if yesterday, they had thirty incoming calls or sixty. They can't tell you where they came from. They can't tell you what percent went to voicemail. And then the hygienist -- on top of all that -- the hygienist and the assistant, instead of the hygienist scheduling a six-month recall or the assistant scheduling the next appointment, they just go out and throw the chart on the front and say, \"You do it,\" as if she's a clerk. Man, that lady is inbound sales. She's driving the whole show. You can go back through a hygienist and schedule your own damn appointment. Tell the assistant, \"You schedule the crown seat or the next one.\" Do it all in the back because the incoming calls are sacred, so that means 80% of dentists will never take her to a dental course, a dental convention, won't educate her, spend no time, no money.

I kind of thin of it like a choreographer. We're directing everyone to what they need to do and helping them, giving them too tools to be leaders. That's the biggest thing. We should be the biggest cheerleader for our team. We're empowering them and we're helping them to learn and grow. If I could change one thing in our dental world, and I hope that you can get Heather and Laurie to work this out with you, because on e of my biggest causes, is to make it mandatory for front office team members to have to have CE.  Before you think, oh we don't see patients. What good would it do? I beg to differ. We see patients every single day. We talk to patients. We may see patients when you're not in the office. We're the only ones who can because we answer that phone. We should be just as educated, if not more so, because of the fact, everything we do is a reflection of you. Why would you not want us to be at our best?\u00a0  Mind you, it's not gonna work for everyone. I'm well aware that there are people that are hired that are simply there for the paycheck. I also know that there are people there like your front office lady, and myself, who really care and want the best.

The thing I've been doing the last three or four years is trying to teach dentists the John Kois kind of principle, diagnose them at hello. If you look at the patient and just have a conversation with them in that chair we know the major risk factors are for dental caries. You know the number one is saliva. And for most patients now that's medication related. We've got 70% of our of our entire population in the U.S. take one prescription medication per day and that's across all age demographics. 50% take two or more and 20% five or more and you see these people every day in your dental practice and you sound [0.7] and they start talking in their mouth is dry. There was a study done in the JADA that was published a few years ago and it was a survey of patient self-reporting dry mouth and it was somewhere around 7%. We did the same study based on our caries risk assessment forms and they came in at 63% of my patients self-identified that they feel like they have a dry mouth at some time of the day or night. Some of this is related to other general systemic issues or auto immune stuff, but primarily it's medications. Howard, even our kids... We've got like seventeen million children in the United States taking anti... Psychiatric drugs, anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, ADHD drugs. That's the crazy part of this. We've got kids that are coming in with dry mouth when they sit down typically... You and I struggled with trying to get isolation in the mouth so you could do any dentistry, because there's so much saliva and now we've got kids that have dry mouth. So that's the number one risk factor for dental caries. So look at them and ask if they have a dry mouth. The second in our caries risk assessment for by survey, and this is now over thirteen thousand patients at six different dental practices, 55% of them self-identified that they have a dietary issue. They're either eating too much sugar or they're eating too frequently. They're snacking throughout the day and I think that's part of our lifestyle as well, but Howard, the American diet... We eat twenty three teaspoons of sugar a day. I'd recommend everybody listening to this podcast is go home tonight, pull out a Ziploc bag and put twenty three teaspoons of sugar in there and see what that looks like. World Health Organization recommends that we should be eating somewhere around two thirds of one teaspoon per day. And on top of that we consume the most high fructose corn syrup of any country on the planet at fifty one pounds per person per year. So we've got a huge dietary risk and it's based primarily on the amount of sugar or the frequency we're eating. You start asking people.
