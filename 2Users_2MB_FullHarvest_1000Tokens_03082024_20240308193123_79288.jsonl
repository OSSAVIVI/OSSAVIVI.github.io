For years I have advocated building a \"Class\" of nuclear power plants the size of a aircraft carrier plant. It takes about 6 years to build the entire aircraft carrier. I imagine that the plant could be built in a bunch less time. \u00a0Almost 400 MW of generation capability in one small plant as you wont need to turn a screw that energy would go into the electrical generation output. 400 Million watts is a lot of of 100 watt light bulbs! Not sure if you have ever been to San Diego but at any one time there are a bunch of the carriers tied up.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0A1B reactor plant\u00a0is an\u00a0aircraft carrier\u00a0nuclear reactor\u00a0developed by the\u00a0United States Navy. It is used in\u00a0Gerald R. Ford-class\u00a0aircraft carriers\u00a0to provide electrical and propulsion energy. The A1B is the first naval reactor produced by\u00a0Bechtel Corporation, which has \"performed engineering and/or construction services on more than 80 percent of [land-based] nuclear plants in the United States\".[1]\nAircraft carriers' nuclear reactors provide the electrical and motor energy of the ship by splitting\u00a0enriched uranium\u00a0to produce heat and convert water to steam to power steam\u00a0turbines. This process is largely the same as in land-based nuclear power stations, the most notable difference being the direct use of turboshaft power for turning the ship's screws. Over decades of development several other design differences have emerged between naval reactors and the usually much larger power station reactors.\nAs Navy planners developed requirements for the\u00a0Gerald R. Ford\u00a0class, they concluded that the\u00a0A4W reactors\u00a0that provide\u00a0propulsion\u00a0and\u00a0electricity\u00a0for the predecessor\u00a0Nimitz-class aircraft carriers\u00a0offer too little power for contemporary and anticipated future shipboard needs,[2]\u00a0so they commissioned a new reactor from Bechtel.[1]\nThe new reactor was named A1B, following the Navy's reactor-designation scheme of type, generation, and manufacturer: A for aircraft carrier, 1 for the maker's first reactor plant design, and B for Bechtel.[3]\u00a0Two A1B reactor plants will power each\u00a0Gerald R. Ford\u00a0class ship.\nIt is estimated that the total thermal power output of the A1B will be around 700 MW, some 25% more than provided by the A4W.[4]\u00a0Improved efficiency in the total plant is expected to provide improved output to both propulsion and electrical systems. Using A4W data[5]\u00a0with a 25% increase in thermal power, the A1B reactors likely produce enough steam to generate\u00a0125 megawatts\u00a0(168,000 hp) of electricity, plus 350,000 shaft horsepower\u00a0(260 MW)\u00a0to power the four propeller shafts.[6]"}, {"user": "drpsuedonym", "text": "It should.

For instance, during the Texas blizzard and Houston power outage, nuclear power plants could have continued operating and providing electricity to affected areas.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that the construction of nuclear power plants requires a significant investment of time and resources.

I like the statement you made, \"To be a good leader, you need to narrow the gap between your words and your actions. \" That is profound.I meet once a week with 5 managers from my area. I covered this topic with them last Wednesday.\u00a0 Even though they gave me a lot of good answers, they need to start applying it. That is the topic for this week.I don't care how good of a leader you are, you will always have to deal with aberration. Good leaders start by establishing their business with policy and protocol. They want prediction in their business and they understand the importance of having smart staff they can perform well on the job.\u00a0 This is why companies like Exxon, Microsoft and Dell do testing before they hire. They check out all applicants. They have learned how much stress and loss of revenue a bad hire can cause. I use the Wonderlic test. It's the same test the NFL uses for the quarterbacks. I know dentists that never check references much less get a written application. I do know after hiring, training and firing hundreds of people, you better have your human resources department one of the strongest areas of your practice. When you hire the right people, get them trained, the leadership gig becomes a lot easier.\u00a0 I like to have good staff that are all equal working as a team. Hiring well makes the difference. You now have people that understand your goals and they work with you to reach your vision. It's all about the folks on your team. If they screw up, they are bright and have ability,\u00a0 so it can be turned around FAST. You don't have to pull them along and constantly try to motivate them or bribe them with money just to do their jobs.This H/R topic is huge and good leaders know they better pay attention to that area of their business.

If the recession is causing sensitivity, discomfort, or other issues, then treatment may be recommended. However, treating every dehiscence as a pathological condition may not be necessary.\\n\\n## Personal Philosophies\\n\\nIn dentistry, there is no true standard of care, and dentists can treat their patients according to their personal philosophies. For example, if a dentist's philosophy is to prioritize patient comfort and esthetics, they may choose to graft the recession sites. However, if the patient's oral health is stable, and the recession is not causing any issues, then treatment may not be necessary.\\n\\n## Tissue Protection\\n\\nVarnishes and desensitizers, such as calcium pullers or dentin adhesives, cannot compare to the protection provided by one's own tissue. However, these treatments can still be effective in managing sensitivity and discomfort caused by recession.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the relationship between recession and bone loss is not always straightforward, and treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and the dentist's personal philosophy.\\n\\n[Tag: Periodontics]"}]}

A colleague at our regulatory body told me they need individuals who not only have degrees in hygiene, but also higher degrees in other fields, such as Education, and political science, this enhances our critical thinking and ability to think 'outside the box' when it comes to setting policies on a national level.There is also much literature out there extolling the benefits to patients from increased collaboration between the dental and medical care professionals.We must not forget that the RDH is not just involved with perio, but also other aspects of oral health, public health, plus education of patients and student hygienists. For example, in countries with high numbers of dental hygienists, it has been shown the caries rate is lower.Not so long ago, people were saying the same thing about higher degrees for Nurses, saying if they can do that, why not just become a Dr?
