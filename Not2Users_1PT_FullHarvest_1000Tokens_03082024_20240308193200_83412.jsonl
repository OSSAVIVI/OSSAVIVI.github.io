What I do is not necessarily teaching sales, sales, sales. Instead teaching value, value, value. What is it that you want to do? What is the value of that? Do they understand the value of that? Do they know why it is worth it for a patient to do this? And then let's bring everyone along. Sometimes when I go in to work with dentists, they don't necessarily see the value of their dentistry. So that's one of the first thing I want to look at. I want to look at their treatment planning process even though I'm not a dentist. I want to see what is their thought process? Usually they just focus on one tooth or their staff member has already told them their insurance will pay for this and that's it. And so they focus on what kind of dentistry I can sell, if they even use that word, just within that insurance limitation. I rarely find a dentist who cannot communicate. If they can't communicate then I do want to hide them or not let them ruin it because sometimes they'll talk too soon. Talk too fast. Simple things like for example I time the consultation on doctors. How long does it take for a patient to accept treatment? How long? Is it five minutes, ten minutes? Is it 15 minutes or 45? I don't tell doctors talk five minutes and shut up. I just want to know when are you effective? When does a patient say yes in the conversation? When does the light bulb go on and they say oh I see this is what I want. When does that happen? Many times their staff members know and their staff members know when the doctor should shut up. Know what the doctor says that they shouldn't. I was in Nacogdoches, Texas, implant practice and the doctor wanted to do more implant dentistry. His staff told me, \"You know he'll talk and talk and talk to a patient going from treatment plan to treatment plan to treatment plan to treatment plan until they accept a swing lock partial. I'll never forget that visit. I didn't even know what a swing lock partial was. I said what do you mean? What's a swing lock partial? They showed me. Little posterior segments that clicked in, locked in. At any rate, I said what do you mean he talks and talks until they accept a swing lock partial? And they said, \"It's the last thing he's got to offer.\" He just presents this. If that doesn't hit he presents the next thing. If that doesn't hit he presents the next thing until the treatment value goes down and down and down and down and down until he has nothing of less value than the swing lock partial. I said so what should he do? They said, \"If he would just shut up patients would accept treatment.\" I said well how can we get him to shut up? One doctor I timed, if he talked more than 15 minutes we audited simply the function of time.

To help them, she examines their treatment planning process and encourages them to focus on the overall value of the treatment rather than just what the insurance covers.\\n\\nOne of the techniques Joy Millis uses is timing the consultation process. She observes how long it takes for a patient to accept a treatment plan. By understanding the effective communication window, doctors can determine the best time to present the treatment plan and when to let the patient absorb the information.\\n\\nJoy Millis also highlights the importance of staff members in the communication process. They often know when a doctor should stop talking and when the patient is ready to accept the treatment. By working together, doctors and staff members can create a more effective communication strategy that results in higher treatment plan acceptance rates.\\n\\n[Tag: The Business of Implant Dentistry]"}]}

I don't care what you do. The first thing either you start measuring it. I'll walk into a dentist office and say, \"Hey, Sully. If a 100 people argue in the cavity, how many do you close and convert to drill, fill and bill?\" And they slay you with their eyes. Okay, so if you don't know you're getting an F or a D, what's the first rule a day a meeting? You have to admit you have a problem. You have to go in there and say, \"Hey, I'm Howard and I'm an alcoholic.\" You have to go in there and say, \"I only got a 38% closed rate\". Then you share that with your team. Like, we know in our team \u2013 we can line up everybody. We have a packing order on whose eye is closed, right. I mean my thirty-year dental assistant, Jan, I mean everybody in the office wants her to do the job, but sometimes she can't. She's busy; she's doing something else. So, then who would be your second go-to person? Well, we'd want Dawn. I don't even make the top fifty percentile, and I'm a dentist with an MBA. The alphabet soup shit means nothing. The terms we use; 5,000 words of Latin and Greek they don't even understand. I would start measuring it first, then I realize, okay if half of our patients have bought a $30,000 new car, what's the difference? Well, you see the car it just says 30 grand. Then you sit there and you'll see if you can get approved. A lot of these people get approved before they go in there, but you know you're walking into the room and just saying, \"Hey, gosh. Congratulations, man\". We can do the whole thing, the whole $30,000 new car for just $450 a month for 60 months. Is that something you wanna do? 10% of the dentists can do that every single month. It's at least 10%, and"}]}, "parent_index": null, "conversion_was_successful": true, "converted_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi, DentalBot!

He suggests that dentists should first measure their performance and then analyze the results to improve their services.\\n\\nFor example, if a dentist wants to increase their closed rate, they should measure the number of patients who agree to a procedure and then compare it to the number of patients who actually go through with the treatment. This can help the dentist identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments.\\n\\nHoward also suggests that dentists should share their performance metrics with their team to encourage a collaborative approach to improving their services. By doing so, everyone in the office can work together to improve the patient experience and increase the practice's success.\\n\\n[Tag: Keepin\u2019 it Real]"}]}

You have a tremendous amount of patients that have dental anxiety. How do we solve that? Yes, I've seen some of the videos of some things you have done in training and teaching, treatment presentation and working with the apprehensive patient, but all of those things don't always cut it for the most extreme side. Anxiolysis, conscious sedation, deep sedation, a general anesthesia, if you can offer that service in these practices, to all of my colleagues in Southern California, and later nation-wide, it's a phone call away for the office to pick it up and say, \"Hey, guys, we need help with this patient. Can you come down?\" We come down, we put the patient at ease, they sleep and dream all of their anxieties away. We get to a quiet sense. I do a lot of full-mod rehabs, a lot of All-On-8's, All-On-4's, full-mod extractions, and it's really convenient when the patient is not gagging and is not regurgitating. You can do your work in a clean environment and knock it out in a speedy, and the patient is comfortable. They wake up, which is my biggest thing in dentistry, what I love is when they wake up with this newfound confidence. It's amazing. We thought that it would be a good idea to provide this service, like a double pack, to every practice in Southern California. When they call us, we bring our own carts, we go in, they have a room for us, we set up 15 minutes, we have already done all our homework on the patient's medical history and have given them all the instructions and the consents, and we get to work. The patients are happy and they spread the word, and it's a good situation. I think it's very important to offer this type of service to all patients. As you know, not everybody likes us. We're doing something really good for society. If they like this, there would be a big line out the door, but people are afraid of us. They're afraid of root canals, they're afraid of extractions, they're afraid of all of it. Howard Farran: I don't think they are afraid of dentists, I think they're afraid of the dental assistant. Dr. Kianor Shah: Okay, they're afraid of the needle, if you want to get down to the- Howard Farran: Yeah, no. It's that scary dental assistant, it's not the dentist, we're the nice guy. I have a lot. When you lecture around the world, and man, if anybody's lectured around the world, it's been you. Hell, you've lived in, what, three countries? You know, other countries do not allow the surgeon to do the anesthesia. They say no. In American hospitals, the cardiovascular surgeon can't do the anesthesia, in any hospital in America.
