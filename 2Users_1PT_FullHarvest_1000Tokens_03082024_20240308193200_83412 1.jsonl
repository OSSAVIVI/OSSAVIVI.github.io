That's too close. I want to know another thing. When the guy disagree with you guys and marketing in general, Billy and I disagree with this, dentists like they're trying to get like cosmetic cases. So they're trying to get implant cases. I don't even like that business. I mean I'm a doctor. You had to go in the emergency room and you broke your leg and you walk in and say, \"You know, we don't do legs. We just do arms.\"  I mean I'm a doctor for Ahwatukee and I just want bodies. You said earlier, you want bodies. I want bodies and then when those bodies are coming in, if a lot of them need this, I'll go learn that for the last 30 years. I got my MAGD, my MAG. I'm your doctor. I want bodies and my goal was to lower the disease missing and filled teeth rate of my community. The first thing I did in '89 was get fluoride in the water and then it was a 20-year law and expired and we had to go back and get it again.\u00a0  I'd rather have my hygienist and the second grade classes teaching those kids how to brush and floss because all the research shows that behavioral change, especially if the mother's involved where the father statistically doesn't show up because half the kids in America are in a single-family house, that if you go in there and teach those kids how to brush and floss, the DMFT goes down, not the 4H terminologies but I just like that ... I just think it's ... you run a hospital. You have people that you know. You say you're in a small town of Parsons, Kansas. I mean whatever little human walks in your door needs you. You know I mean?

Certainly, it can be a significant contributor but one of our colleagues and a fan of our method, actually Dr. Chip Liev, who is a cardiologist out of the Ochsner clinic down in New Orleans.

So, somebody can be overweight and even obese. But if they\u2019re physically fit, it greatly mitigates the potential harm from that obesity, doesn\u2019t totally but it can make a huge dent in it. So, you can take somebody who\u2019s thin, who\u2019s not fat at all. Looks on the surface in great shape and if they\u2019re not fit, their risk for a heart attack and strokes can be much greater than the one who\u2019s overweight and fit. So, fitness, exercise, you know lifestyle is the number one way to beat the heart attack, stroke, dementia risk. To keep the arteries well, we need a good lifestyle and absolutely a critical element for that is to be physically active. Now we don\u2019t require patients of course to go out and run marathons or anything but we want them all to get no less than 22 minutes of equivalent of a brisk walk every day and do some resistive training twice a week.
