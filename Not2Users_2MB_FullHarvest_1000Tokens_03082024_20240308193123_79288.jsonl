When choosing between a tissue valve and a mechanical valve, it's essential to consider the pros and cons of each.\\n\\n**Tissue Valve:**\\n- Does not require long-term anticoagulation\\n- More durable in younger patients\\n- Lower risk of bleeding complications\\n\\n**Mechanical Valve:**\\n- Longer lifespan\\n- Higher risk of bleeding complications\\n- Requires long-term anticoagulation\\n\\nIt's important to note that the choice of valve may depend on factors such as age, activity level, and personal preference. While you are 51 and active, you mentioned not wanting to be on Coumadin for life. In this case, a tissue valve might be a better option for you.\\n\\n## Personal Experiences\\n\\nJosephPotvin, a dentist who had a mitral valve repair in February 2012, shared his experience:\\n\\n- First two days post-op, you might feel lousy, but dilaudid can help.\\n- By day 3, you should start feeling much better.\\n- Appetite returns gradually, and energy levels improve by week 3.\\n- Return to work part-time around week 4, starting with lightly scheduled days and no extractions for a few more weeks.\\n\\nJoseph's experience highlights the importance of preparing for a significant event in your life and taking time to recover.

RECAP of the GOOD & BAD for direct mail since COVID from MVP Maillhouse: Mid-March 2020 Covid hit the fan when they canceled the NCAA tourney and all hell broke loose from there right! :) We instantly paused and held 98% of our client\u2019s mailings. A few brave souls wanted to push through and keep mailing and they actually did pretty well when it was all said and done even though most of the treatment wasn\u2019t done for a few months. Most offices closed up shop though and it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense it seemed to do any marketing. By mid-April and into May, June we started mailing pretty heavy again because we were seeing really good results from those initial offices that stuck to the game plan. WHY? I think for a couple of reasons the results were GOOD. Many of their competitors were closed or only seeing emergencies. Almost all offices stopped marketing so those that kept marketing were scooping up the new patients. Especially emergencies! People were home! Working from home, schooling their kids from home, and seeing their mail more than ever. Think back to those months, the only fresh air many of us got for months was when we grabbed the kids, leashed up our dog, and walked down to the mailbox! (This is still happening in many areas, more people are working from home now more than ever and they are looking at their mail and responding). The first round of stimulus checks hit bank accounts or mailed out, plus many people were making the same or more money than before but nowhere to go to spend it. Fast forward to the end of Summer in July and August and things were as HOT as ever for our offices! Almost all our dentists were back up and mailing full steam plus many new offices that had received their PPP money and were feeling better about the situation and determined to recover for lost months of work. Many also saw the BIG holes in hygiene coming in Sept and Nov because they hadn\u2019t seen any patients 6-months prior so they wanted to ramp up and fill those holes. The results in most markets in this time frame were as good as ever! In fact, many of my offices that had mailed monthly for years were outperforming any previous year over the same time span. HOWEVER...... Something we did not see coming was how bad things got for many offices in Nov and Dec. WHY? I think for a couple of reasons the results were BAD. Presidential election.

Sue Seale, Gerald N. Glickman Title: Contemporary Perspectives on Vital Pulp Therapy: Views From the Endodontists and Pediatric Dentists Abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the level of agreement between pediatric dentists and endodontists at a pulp therapy symposium conjointly sponsored by the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) on November 2\u20133, 2007. Presymposium and postsymposium tests were administered, and respondent answers were compared between pediatric dentists and endodontists. Opinions on 3 areas were sought: pulp therapy for cariously involved primary teeth; indirect pulp treatment (IPT) for cariously involved immature permanent teeth; and innovative treatment options including pulpal revascularization and regeneration. Results were analyzed with x2 tests. Comparisons of presymposium and postsymposium responses and between the 2 groups of attendees indicated that the pediatric dentistry and endodontic communities agree that formocresol will be replaced as a primary tooth pulpotomy agent, that mineral trioxide is the first choice to take its place, that IPT in primary teeth holds hope as a replacement for pulpotomy, and that IPT is an acceptable pulp therapy technique for cariously involved young permanent teeth. Both groups believe that pulp revascularization and regeneration will be viable treatment modalities in the future. The AAE and the AAPD are positioned to begin preparation of best practice guidelines that share common language and treatment recommendations for pulp therapies performed by both specialties.

Hargreaves, Todd Giesler, Michael Henry, Yan Wang Title: Regeneration Potential of the Young Permanent Tooth: What Does the Future Hold? Abstract: During the last 10\u201315 years, there has been a tremendous increase in our clinical \"tools\" (ie, materials, instruments, and medications) and knowledge from the trauma and tissue engineering fields that can be applied to regeneration of a functional pulp-dentin complex. In addition, recent case reports indicate that biologically based endodontic therapies can result in continued root development, increased dentinal wall thickness, and apical closure when treating cases of necrotic immature permanent teeth. The purpose of this review was to summarize these findings and illustrate a path forward for the development and evaluation of regenerative endodontic therapies. (Pediatr.

The patient is getting full upper and lower dentures and three lower implants with locators.\\n\\nThe premolars were extracted, and the implants were placed. After integration, new dentures with the posterior locators in place will be made. This will reduce the pain on the fresh wounds when the immediate denture goes in.\\n\\n### Zirconia and PFM\\n\\nRegarding the use of zirconia in the posteriors and PFM in the anterior, it is unclear from the discussion whether the PFM will be cut back for porcelain margins. The need for zirconia in the back is not explicitly explained.\\n\\n### Implant Restorations\\n\\nOn the implant restorations, it is not explicitly stated if these engage the internal aspect of the implants. The choice of screw-retained cases as a standard implant restoration of choice is also not explicitly stated.\\n\\n### Screw-Retained Restorations\\n\\nThe user seems to be trying to do more screw-retained restorations, particularly on the maxillary posteriors. The closure of the screw-access is not an esthetic issue in this case. The user is curious about the reason for choosing zirconia for the optical properties when closing the access with composite.\\n\\nIn response, the user thanks the original poster in advance for their insights.\\n\\n[Tag: Restorative Dentistry]"}]}
