        <p align="left">A bit about myself...</p>
        <ul align="left">
          <li>My wife <strong>Bayleigh</strong> and I have a son, <strong>Jasper</strong>!</li>
          <li>I have a degree in <strong>Business Management</strong> from NAU.</li>
          <li>I am studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> online through OSU.</li>
          <li>I enjoy <strong>Audio</strong> and <strong>Video</strong> production.</li>
          <li>I've travelled to over <strong>20 countries</strong> in <strong>five continents</strong>!</li>
          <li>We also have a cat, <strong>Chai</strong> (I guess I should mention her).</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always loved technology. When I was a kid, I was the "go to"
          brother when it came to fixing the VCR or setting up the TV. I guess
          you could say I was a bit of a nerd, but I've always worn it as a badge of honor!<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While studying Busines Management at Northern Arizona University, I developed a
          passion for audio production. My hobby of playing the piano combined with the power of
          computers and robust softwares opened up to me an entirely new realm of possibilities - and I was
          hooked! <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a stroke of grace, my passion ended up proving useful to me professionally, as my
          Father's media company was in need of an editor for their new podcast, <em>Dentistry Uncensored</em>. I was
          lucky enough
          for them to offer me the position, and I was very grateful for the opportunity, so I finished my last
          few classes online and began working right away! Little did I know that in addition to this job allowing me to
          explore new avenues of media production such as video editing and social media marketing, I would also have
          the immense privelage to travel all over the world; from Johannesburg, South Africa to Tokyo, Japan! <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere along the way I fell in love with my beautiful wife and had a baby, too,
          which is my favorite part of this story! Deciding to make a career change while my son was still young, I
          enrolled back in school to pursue a degree in
          Computer Science - and it's been an amazing experience! I am very interested to see what the future holds, and
          in an ever-changing industry, the
          possibilities are endless! Staying true to my roots, I have a keen interest in electronic media production,
          streaming
          technologies, and virtual reality applications. <br>
