        <p align="left">A bit about myself...</p>
        <ul align="left">
          <li>My wife <strong>Bayleigh</strong> and I have a son, <strong>Jasper</strong>!</li>
          <li>I have a degree in <strong>Business Management</strong> from <strong>NAU</strong>.</li>
          <li>I am studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> online through <strong>OSU</strong>.</li>
          <li>I'm very interested in <strong>Mobile Development</strong> and <strong>App Design</strong>.</li>
          <li>I enjoy <strong>Audio</strong> and <strong>Video</strong> production.</li>
          <li>I've travelled to over <strong>20 countries</strong> in <strong>five continents</strong>!</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While studying Busines Management at Northern Arizona University, I developed a
          passion for audio production. My hobby of playing the piano combined with the power of
          computers and robust softwares opened up to me an entirely new realm of possibilities - and I was
          hooked! <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a stroke of grace, my passion ended up proving useful to me professionally, as my
          Father's media company was in need of an editor for their new podcast, <em>Dentistry Uncensored</em>. I was
          lucky enough
          for them to offer me the position, and I was very grateful for the opportunity, so I finished my last
          few classes online and began working. Little did I know that in addition to this job allowing me to
          explore new avenues of media production such as video editing and social media marketing, I would also have
          the immense privelage to travel all over the world; from Johannesburg, South Africa to Tokyo, Japan! <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere along the way I fell in love with my beautiful wife, Bayleigh, and we had a baby!
           Deciding to make a career change while my son was still young, I
          enrolled back in school to pursue a degree in
          Computer Science and I'm really glad that I began this journey. I am very interested to see what the future holds, and
          in an ever-changing world of technology, the
          possibilities are endless! I have a keen interest in digital media production, mobile development,
          streaming technologies, and virtual reality applications. <br>
