[/INST]A root canal procedure is a dental treatment designed to repair and save a tooth that is badly decayed or infected.

I suspect a muscle engramming phenomena in reverse, but I'm not sure if fabricating a Kois type deprogrammer would help. I don't have access to a TENS unit and am considering a TAP apnea appliance. Any thoughts? [/INST]## Addressing the Apnea\\nFirst, it is essential to address the apnea treatment. Make sure that nothing is done that might compromise the patient's airway and sleep-disordered breathing. If the patient is dead, the open bite won't be much of a problem.\\n\\n## Oral Appliance and CPAP\\nWearing an oral appliance, such as a TAP or Somnomed, may make wearing the CPAP easier. If the patient has to ramp the pressure on the CPAP pretty high, you might consider looking into that.\\n\\n## Revealing the Open Bite\\nThe open bite might be more of a case of 'revealing' an open bite that had been hidden, rather than causing it. This is similar to anterior open bites sometimes seen with NTI's.\\n\\n## TAP Appliance\\nConsidering a TAP apnea appliance to slowly bring the mandible forward is an option.

[/INST]## Breakaway Start-Up Success Analysis\\n\\nThere are two primary factors to consider when analyzing the success of a 'breakaway' start-up dental practice:\\n\\n1. **Per hour dentist time worked**: This metric measures the efficiency and productivity of the practice based on the time the dentist puts in. For example, if a practice generates $670 per hour with an average of 4.4 days per week, it is considered decent, especially during the startup phase. As the practice expands its facility and staff, the hourly rate should increase.\\n\\n2. **Overall sum**: This metric shows the demand the practice has created in a specific area and indicates the practice's potential. For a 2-year-old practice with $3.6M in production and 11 dentist days per week, this indicates explosive 'breakaway' growth.\\n\\nA smaller practice with high demand can increase its fees and profitability dramatically.

The gingival margins are then scalloped, starting from the second bicuspid to the second bicuspid on the upper arch. The laser is held active in a location to remove tissue, and slow passes can help achieve the most accurate results. Debulking the tissue can also be helpful to aid in proper margin creation.

However, it is important to follow the recommended guidelines and protocols to achieve the best results.\\n\\n### Retention and Recommendations\\n\\n* To stabilize a lower denture, you need at least 4 minis, as recommended by manufacturers.\\n* Placing 2 minis can result in premature failure, as they have a smaller implant-to-bone contact area.\\n* If you need more retention, you can place more mini-implants.\\n* For full lower dentures, 4 minis are recommended to distribute occlusal forces more evenly and promote osteointegration.\\n* Adjusting occlusion judiciously is essential to protect implants and prevent overloading.\\n* Glidewell mini-implants have a similar size to 3M-Minis, and the retention can be adjusted by changing the o-rings.\\n* The retention of Glidewell minis may not be as strong as other brands, but placing 2 mini-implants instead of one can provide the same retention.\\n* Glidewell minis are easy to place, but the retention may not be as strong as other brands, especially for lower RPDs.\\n* When comparing Glidewell minis to other brands, consider factors like ease of placement, retention, and overall performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Tag: Mini Implants]</s>"}

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] I'm scheduled tomorrow AM to have my Aortic Valve replaced. I picked a tissue valve over a mechanical. Had the cath done yesterday and everything else is OK. Have till 5PM to change my mind. I'm 51 and pretty active outside so didn't like the option of Coumadin for life. Any thoughts or suggestions that I should consider? [/INST]## Tissue vs. Mechanical Valve\\n\\nIt's great to hear that you've had your cath done and everything else is OK. Choosing a tissue valve over a mechanical one is a common decision for those who are more active and want to avoid taking Coumadin for life.\\n\\n## Recovery Experience\\n\\nOne dentist shared their experience with a mitral valve repair in February 2012 at Mt. Sinai Hospital NY. They were out of work for about 5 weeks, with the first two days post-op being the most difficult. By day 4, they were sent home, and their appetite slowly returned. Week 3 saw their energy returning, and week 4 they started going to the office for paperwork. Week 5, they returned to work with lightly scheduled days and no extractions for a few more weeks.\\n\\n## Preparation and Valve Type\\n\\nIn terms of preparation, the surgeon used a mitral valve repair in this case. It's essential to discuss the specifics of your surgery with your medical team, as they can provide tailored advice based on your situation.\\n\\n## Handling the Office\\n\\nDuring your recovery, consider delegating tasks to trusted colleagues or staff members. This can help ensure that the office runs smoothly in your absence.\\n\\n## Additional Questions\\n\\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask. It's essential to gather as much information as possible to make informed decisions about your health and recovery.\\n\\n[Tag: General Health]</s> [INST] Can you provide tips on why you need small access for a procedure without endodontic treatment? [/INST]## Access Preparation\\n\\n- Aim for a superb access to the pulp chamber.\\n- Inspect the screw for wear and replace it if necessary.\\n- Torque the screw down to ensure stability.\\n- Check excursives and make sure the crown remains stable.\\n- If you need to repair the crown, assess if there is porcelain or not. If there is, you can make it disappear; if not, you may not achieve a good result.\\n- Use a strong luting agent to secure the crown.\\n- Use a torque wrench to avoid screw loosening.\\n- Use Kerr color white opaque or Cosmedent Pink Opaque for better results.\\n- Avoid using Cavit, as it cannot be bonded to and is not needed for this procedure.\\n\\n[Tag: Endodontics]</s>"}

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] I have a patient with a long-term Invisalign treatment from an orthodontist. Her posterior teeth are not yet contacting, and her maximum intercuspation is biting on her anterior teeth. The orthodontist suggested regular braces. What are the chances conventional braces will close her bite? Here are some original pics of her bite in 2015 when she began clear braces. [/INST]## Evaluation of the Case\\n\\nBased on the provided information and images, it seems that your patient has a skeletal class III case with a posterior open bite. The patient started with an anterior edge-to-edge bite and chipping teeth. The orthodontist attempted to correct the issue with Invisalign, but it appears that they ran out of overjet.\\n\\n## Possible Solutions\\n\\n1. **Super Heavy Elastics**: The orthodontist might suggest using super heavy elastics to help close the bite. However, this approach may not be enough for a significant class III case.\\n\\n2. **Palatal Expansion**: The patient might have benefited from palatal expansion, which could help create more space for proper alignment.\\n\\n3. **Extraction of Bicuspids**: This option involves extracting four bicuspids with minimal/maximum anchorage, which could increase the chances of getting the patient into a Class I finish with proper overjet. However, this approach could negatively affect her profile, and patients usually dislike reducing the space for the tongue.\\n\\n4. **Orthognathic Surgery**: This is often the last resort, but it might be the only viable solution for a severe class III case. It would help achieve proper alignment and bite, but it requires surgery and a longer recovery period.\\n\\nIt is crucial to consult with the orthodontist to understand their plan and discuss the best options for the patient's situation. The patient's concerns are valid, and it's essential to address her fears and provide reassurance throughout the treatment process.\\n\\n[Tag: Orthodontics]</s>"}

What's on your mind?.</s> [INST] Can an air space in a crown change pressure depending on atmospheric air? I'm having a hard time understanding how this could be possible. [/INST]You're right, it's not likely that an air space in a crown would change pressure depending on atmospheric air. A crown is rigid and cannot flex to allow for pressure changes.\\n\\nTo test this, you can try pressing hard on the crown with an amalgam plugger. It's unlikely that you'll be able to move the crown, as it would require exerting more than 100 psi.\\n\\nAtmospheric pressure changes would not have a significant impact on the crown. The pressure doesn't typically drop much below 10 psi, and a 5 psi difference would not be enough to move the crown.\\n\\nIf you find a study that proves otherwise, I'd be happy to review it and adjust my understanding accordingly.\\n\\n[Tag: Fixed Prosthodontics]</s> [INST] What are your thoughts on Spears Education being sold to Private Equity? Do you think it will affect the quality of the information provided? [/INST]## Expansion of Spears Education\\n\\nThe expansion of Spears Education and the introduction of more instructors, like Spears Jr., can be seen as a positive development. The idea is that the same information will be available, but at a potentially lower cost.\\n\\n## The Changing Landscape of Learning\\n\\nThe way we learn has changed significantly over the years, with the rise of technology and online platforms. This shift has allowed for more accessible and diverse learning opportunities, but it might not always be as effective as the traditional, personalized learning experience.\\n\\n## The Value of Information\\n\\nThe quality of information provided by Spears Education may not be directly affected by the sale. However, the quality of instruction can be influenced by the instructors' skills and ability to deliver the information.\\n\\nIn summary, the sale of Spears Education to Private Equity may bring about more accessible learning opportunities, but it is essential to maintain the quality of instruction and the value of the information provided.\\n\\n[Tag: CE Comments / Suggestions / Events]</s>"}

[/INST]When referring a patient to an endodontist for endo failure, I would be transparent and explain the situation. I would tell them that despite our best efforts, the previous treatment did not have the desired outcome. It's essential to reassure them that their well-being is your top priority and that you are taking the necessary steps to address the issue.\\n\\nWhen discussing the financial aspect, I would approach it with empathy and understanding. I would wait for the specialist's assessment before making any decisions on refunds. If the endodontist determines that retreatment is necessary, I would consider offering a partial refund or working with the patient on a deal for a replacement.\\n\\nHowever, I would not raise my fees to cover the costs, as it may not be realistic in today's PPO world.

Are there any concerns regarding the success rates of implants placed in sockets grafted with allografts and Bio-Oss? [/INST]There is a debate in the dental community regarding the use of allografts in dental implants. Some argue that allografts are not osteoinductive, do not stimulate osteogenesis, are never resorbed, and never turn into normal bone. They also point out that there is no scientific basis for putting implants in sockets grafted with these materials and that we have no idea what the success rates are for implants placed in sockets grafted with allografts and Bio-Oss.\\n\\nIt is important to be aware of these concerns and consult the latest scientific literature to make informed decisions regarding the use of allografts in dental implants.\\n\\n[Tag: Implantology]</s>"}
