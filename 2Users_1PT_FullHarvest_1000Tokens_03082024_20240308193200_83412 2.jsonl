Effective leadership is also crucial.\\n\\n### Interoffice Communication\\n\\nConsider implementing interoffice communication tools like walkie-talkies to streamline communication and improve efficiency. This can help reduce the need for staff to run around the office, saving time and energy.\\n\\n### Technology in Dental Offices\\n\\nWhile technology can greatly benefit a dental office, it's essential to ensure that all team members are comfortable and proficient with its use. For instance, if an assistant or hygienist has difficulty with loops, it might be more beneficial to provide additional training or consider other options rather than replacing them with someone who may have the same challenges.\\n\\n### Looping and Communication\\n\\nWhen it comes to looping, it's essential to ensure that all team members are proficient and comfortable with the technology. Firing someone with cataracts or other issues that might affect their ability to use loops effectively might not be the best solution.

Certainly, it can be a significant contributor but one of our colleagues and a fan of our method, actually Dr. Chip Liev, who is a cardiologist out of the Ochsner clinic down in New Orleans.

So, somebody can be overweight and even obese. But if they\u2019re physically fit, it greatly mitigates the potential harm from that obesity, doesn\u2019t totally but it can make a huge dent in it. So, you can take somebody who\u2019s thin, who\u2019s not fat at all. Looks on the surface in great shape and if they\u2019re not fit, their risk for a heart attack and strokes can be much greater than the one who\u2019s overweight and fit. So, fitness, exercise, you know lifestyle is the number one way to beat the heart attack, stroke, dementia risk. To keep the arteries well, we need a good lifestyle and absolutely a critical element for that is to be physically active. Now we don\u2019t require patients of course to go out and run marathons or anything but we want them all to get no less than 22 minutes of equivalent of a brisk walk every day and do some resistive training twice a week.
