It\u2019s great to see your interest in building a successful dental team. Here are some insights from the conversation between Howard Farran and Claudia Lovato.\\n\\n# Recruiting and Training\\n\\nClaudia Lovato emphasized the importance of recruiting the best of the best, just like a football team. Once you have them, she suggests providing the necessary resources and leading them effectively.\\n\\n# Communication\\n\\nHoward Farran mentioned the use of interoffice communication devices like walkie-talkies to streamline communication between team members. Although it might not be common, it can be an effective way to improve communication.\\n\\nClaudia Lovato also mentioned the use of loops for all employees, but Howard Farran pointed out that if an assistant or hygienist needs loops, it might be better to consider other options, such as hiring someone with better communication skills.\\n\\nRemember, Mikhail, the key to a successful dental practice is a winning team. Keep learning and improving your leadership skills to help your team thrive.\\n\\n[Tag: How To Hire And Train]"}]}}

It's not that you're like \u2018I want to fill seventeen fillings today\u2019, you\u2019re like I want to fill this filling because it's important, because you're tooth will fall out of it if it's not.

So, somebody can be overweight and even obese. But if they\u2019re physically fit, it greatly mitigates the potential harm from that obesity, doesn\u2019t totally but it can make a huge dent in it. So, you can take somebody who\u2019s thin, who\u2019s not fat at all. Looks on the surface in great shape and if they\u2019re not fit, their risk for a heart attack and strokes can be much greater than the one who\u2019s overweight and fit. So, fitness, exercise, you know lifestyle is the number one way to beat the heart attack, stroke, dementia risk. To keep the arteries well, we need a good lifestyle and absolutely a critical element for that is to be physically active. Now we don\u2019t require patients of course to go out and run marathons or anything but we want them all to get no less than 22 minutes of equivalent of a brisk walk every day and do some resistive training twice a week.
